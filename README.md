# -college-sports-committee

Created a college sports committee management system in C language involves managing sports events, teams, and participants.

In this code, we define two structures: 

Participants to represent a participant's details 

Team to represent a team and its participants. 

The main function allows users to create teams, add participants to teams, and display team details.
